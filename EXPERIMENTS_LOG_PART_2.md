The CLARIN repo was pulled anew to get the non-suitable dataset. Dataset construction will begin by reading all of the data, regardless of the duplicate flag.

I shall open a new notebook for this, namely 25_suitable_dataset_construction.

I note there are 1002 suitable documents and only 123 nonsuitable. Data has been saved as `/home/peterr/macocu/task5_webgenres/data/interim/suitable_tabular.csv`.

The experiment is finished. 15 runs have been run on full datasets. If all the results are reshaped into a single matrix, the following figure is obtained:


<img src="images/25_cumulative_CM.png" alt="plot" width="300"/>


If f1_score is calculated across all runs and then averaged, we get **f1 = 0.954 +/- 0.0029**

### Comparison with dummy classifier

Due to enormous class imbalance we really should include a dummy classifer for comparison.

```
Dummy clf: strategy: 'stratified', 0.887 +/- 0.0105
Dummy clf: strategy: 'most_frequent', 0.942 +/- 0.0
```

### Are we better than dummy?

As before a MannWhitney U-test was used to estimate p-value. We get:
```
Dummy clf: strategy: 'stratified', 0.894 +/- 0.00945
	 p_value: 1.69e-06
Dummy clf: strategy: 'most_frequent', 0.942 +/- 0.0
	 p_value: 3.41e-07
```
Note: `stratified` strategy is stochastic, so the results are different from the results above, but they are within 1-sigma from eachother.


## Verdict

Our classifier is statistically significantly better than guessing, but unfortunately it is __only statistically significantly better than guessing__.

## Further possible actionables

* Proper (wandb) or partial (only #epochs) hyperparameter optimization?
* Repeating the training on dedup data? Repeat full grid searching? (i.e. {train_dedup, train_full} Ã— {test_dedup, test_full})

Wrong predictions of all 15 runs have been analyzed by the following protocol:
* For every run, we look at what instances have been misclassified.
* We log their primary label and the true and predicted value, although we only need the primary label, as the sets of suitable primary labels and unsuitable primary labels are disjoint.
* The labels are counted. This produces the following table:

| primary                    |   misclassified_counts |
|:---------------------------|---------:|
| Non-textual                |      125 |
| Not Slovene                |      116 |
| Machine Translation        |       76 |
| Too Short/Incoherent       |       63 |

* This is not very informative as we do not know how frequent these labels are in the test split, so further analysis is needed.
* For all of the test split we count the labels appearing in the first column of the table above. This number is then multiplied by 15 (because we had 15 runs and therefore have 15 times more misclassified instances, which should be accounted for.)
* Numbers of misclassified counts are then divided by the number of counts in the test split. The final result looks like this:

| primary                    |   misclassified_counts |   counts_in_test_split |   misclassification_ratio |

The type of error can be inferred from the label. E.g., for label `Forum` the original instance was labeled as suitable and since it ended up in our table, the classifier misclassified it as nonsuitable.

### Inverted question: which primaries do not get misclassified?

Again a table was constructed:
